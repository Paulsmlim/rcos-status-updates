## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I found an error for the log in implementation. Although I implemented the email verification the previous
> week (week 4), the log in functionality was not working because of a parsing error. The user's log in credentials were
> parsed differently from the way that they are parsed when the user registered their account. Therefore, none of the users
> were able to log in. I fixed the log in credentials parsing in the MainViewController file; now users are able to register
> accounts and log in with no problems.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement the Post functionality where a user can create a Group Ride to share.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nah
