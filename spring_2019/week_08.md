## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've been learning about how data is stored in the Firebase database. The firebase database is not a relational database
> and each row is stored as a dictionary. Therefore, as I am working on the Groupride Post functionality, I will store
> all the ride information in a dictionary, and then store the dictionary into the database. So far, I created the
> createPostViewController, connected all the user interface components to the backend, and started the function for
> the code when the user clicks on "Create Post".

## This Week's Plan

> Work on the createPostViewController

## Anything Blocking?

> No
