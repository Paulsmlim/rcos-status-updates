## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I finished more sections of the iOS Development tutorial on Udemy. I designed the UI / form for
> the "Post" page where a user can fill out the info of a ride that they want to share. All posts follow a specific
> format with the time and date of the pickup, location of the pickup, and how many people can fit in the ride.
> Once the "Post" button is pressed, it prompts the user if they want to the ride to be posted locally or limited
> to friends only.

## This Week's Plan

> Continue to finish sections of the tutorial. Also learn about firebase for data and user accounts.

## Anything Blocking?

> The project file in our Github master branch got corrupted, so we were unable to work on development for almost the
> whole week. The projected is currently still corrupted, so I am just working on my local project.
