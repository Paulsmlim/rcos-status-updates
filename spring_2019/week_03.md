## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I researched a little bit on firebase, and learned how to utilize in it in the backend (e.g.: retrieve
> data from the database, update data, and delete data). I finished a section in the iOS Development tutorial.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement email verification through firebase. It will most likely be a standard email verification where if the
> user creates an account through the RPI GroupRide app, an email will be sent to the registered email, and the user
> would have to click on the verification link.

## Anything Blocking?

> None
