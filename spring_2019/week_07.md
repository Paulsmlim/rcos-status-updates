## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I fixed the email verification feature that I worked on a few weeks ago. I didn't debug the implementation
> completely, and I realized that users can still log in depsite not verifying their accounts through the link sent to their
> email after registration. I made sure to check for the condition if the user has verified their account before logging them
> into their account in the app.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement the Post functionality where a user can create a Group Ride to share. The ride should be stored in the database
> and show up in other people's Hubs.

## Anything Blocking?

> No
