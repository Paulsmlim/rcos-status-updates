## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I looked into how to create a table for each group ride so that whenever a post is created by a user,
> the ride is stored in the database through Firebase. I learned how to access databases, store data, and retrieve data.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement the Post functionality where a user can create a Group Ride to share. The ride should be stored in the database
> and show up in other people's Hubs.

## Anything Blocking?

> No
