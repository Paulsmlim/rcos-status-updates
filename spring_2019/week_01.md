## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I started the iOS Development tutorial on Udemy and finished 4 sections of it. I learned how to create a
> project, organize the UI, and code the backend of an interface. I designed the UI for the Hub Page for our iOS app by adding
> multiple components such as the scrollable component, header, and footer. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue learning from the iOS development tutorial to learn more backend implementations.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope
